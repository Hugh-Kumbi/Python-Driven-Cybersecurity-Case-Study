# Automating the Login Process

## Proposed Resolution

- I implemented a system to validate usernames against an approved users list. First, I designed a process to check if the username matched the list, ensuring the comparison was case-sensitive. If the username matched, the system displayed a message confirming approval, such as `<username> is approved`. However, if the username did not match, the system displayed `<username> is not approved to access the system`. At this point, the validation process for that username halted, and no further checks were performed.
