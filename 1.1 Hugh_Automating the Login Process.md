# Automating the Login Process

## Proposed Resolution

1. I implemented a system to validate usernames against an approved users list. First, I designed a process to check if the username matched the list, ensuring the comparison was case-sensitive. If the username matched, the system displayed a message confirming approval, such as `<username> is approved`. However, if the username did not match, the system displayed `<username> is not approved to access the system`. At this point, the validation process for that username halted, and no further checks were performed.
2. After validating the username, I implemented a device verification process for approved users. The system checked if the device ID matched the one assigned to the user. If the device ID was correct, the system displayed a message confirming the match, such as `<device_id> is the assigned device for <username>`. If the device ID did not match, the system displayed `<device_id> is not the assigned device for <username>`. This additional layer ensured that only authorized devices could be associated with each user.
