# Analyzing Login Activities

## Proposed Resolution 

I designed a system to address key objectives related to login activity monitoring. First, I implemented functionality to calculate and display the total number of logins for the current day. Next, I created a process to calculate the average number of logins per day for each user and display the result.

To enhance security, I added a feature to detect excessive login activity. The system calculated a login ratio by dividing the current day's logins by the average daily logins. If this ratio exceeded a threshold of 3, the system triggered an alert. For instance, if a user had two logins for the current day and an average of one login per day, the ratio of 2/1 equated to 2, which was below the threshold. However, if the user logged in four times in a day, resulting in a ratio of 4/1, the system identified this as excessive and issued an alert.

### Basic Solution (Model 1)

The code uses conditional statements and simple calculations to verify usernames, current day logins, and average logins.
It includes functionality to detect mismatches and outputs messages to flag incorrect or unusual login data.

### Interactive Widget (Model 1 Widget):

An interactive dropdown widget allows for selecting a username, and the displayed results provide real-time feedback about login activity. This implementation enhances user interaction and usability.

### Advanced Solution (Model 2):

The code calculates and displays the login ratio, comparing current day logins to average daily logins.
A threshold of 3 is applied to identify excessive login activity, with appropriate alerts triggered when this condition is met.

### Enhanced Widget (Model 2 Widget):

The interactive widget implementation includes a dropdown and a button to analyze logins dynamically, making the system more user-friendly.
The code calculates and displays login details, including the login ratio, and handles edge cases (e.g., division by zero).
