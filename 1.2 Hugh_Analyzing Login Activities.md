# Analyzing Login Activities

## Proposed Resolution 

**Activity Overview**

I designed a system to address key objectives related to login activity monitoring. First, I implemented functionality to calculate and display the total number of logins for the current day. Next, I created a process to calculate the average number of logins per day for each user and display the result.

To enhance security, I added a feature to detect excessive login activity. The system calculated a login ratio by dividing the current day's logins by the average daily logins. If this ratio exceeded a threshold of `3`, the system triggered an alert. For instance, if a user had two logins for the current day and an average of one login per day, the ratio of `2/1` equated to `2`, which was below the threshold. However, if the user logged in four times in a day, resulting in a ratio of `4/1`, the system identified this as excessive and issued an alert.

### Basic Solution (Model 1)

- In this task, I used conditional statements and simple calculations to verify usernames, check for current day logins, and calculate average logins. I also included functionality to detect mismatches and designed it to output messages that would flag incorrect or unusual login data. This approach helped ensure the accuracy and consistency of the login information.

### Interactive Widget (Model 1 Widget):

- In this task, I implemented an interactive dropdown widget that allowed for selecting a username. The displayed results provided real-time feedback about login activity. This feature enhanced user interaction and improved the overall usability of the system, making it easier to track and assess login data efficiently.

### Advanced Solution (Model 2):

- In this task, I wrote code that calculated and displayed the login ratio, comparing current day logins to the average daily logins. I applied a threshold of `3` to identify excessive login activity and set up alerts to be triggered when this condition was met. This helped in flagging unusual patterns and ensuring that potential security concerns were addressed promptly.

### Enhanced Widget (Model 2 Widget):

- In this task, I implemented an interactive widget that included a dropdown and a button, allowing users to dynamically analyze logins. This made the system more user-friendly by enabling easy access to login data. The code I wrote calculated and displayed login details, including the login ratio, and handled edge cases, such as division by zero, ensuring smooth functionality and avoiding errors.
