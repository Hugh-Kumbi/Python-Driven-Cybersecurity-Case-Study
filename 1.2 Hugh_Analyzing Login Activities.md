# Analyzing Login Activities

## Proposed Resolution 

I designed a system to address key objectives related to login activity monitoring. First, I implemented functionality to calculate and display the total number of logins for the current day. Next, I created a process to calculate the average number of logins per day for each user and display the result.

To enhance security, I added a feature to detect excessive login activity. The system calculated a login ratio by dividing the current day's logins by the average daily logins. If this ratio exceeded a threshold of 3, the system triggered an alert. For instance, if a user had two logins for the current day and an average of one login per day, the ratio of 2/1 equated to 2, which was below the threshold. However, if the user logged in four times in a day, resulting in a ratio of 4/1, the system identified this as excessive and issued an alert.
