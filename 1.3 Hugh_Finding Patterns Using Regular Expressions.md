# Finding Patterns Using Regular Expressions

## Proposed Resolution

### Activity Overview

I focused on identifying patterns in data related to system logs and device activities. The first task was to find the malware signature 0x9ACDAB. I extracted and analyzed this signature from the provided data to detect any potential threats.

Next, I worked on identifying device IDs starting with r15. Using regular expressions, I extracted and displayed the device IDs that matched this pattern, helping automate the process of monitoring devices.

Additionally, I analyzed IP addresses within the logs. Specifically, I identified valid IP addresses in the format 192.xxx.xxx. This step allowed for efficient identification of network-related activities and helped automate the analysis of system logs for security monitoring.

1. **Find the Hex Signature:**

- In this task, I wrote code that correctly extracted the malware signature `0x9ACDAB` from the given string using a regular expression. The pattern `r"\b0x[a-fA-F0-9]+\b"` was used to match any hexadecimal number starting with `0x`, which fulfilled the task's requirements. The output generated was `['0x9ACDAB']`, accurately capturing the desired value.

2. **Find Device IDs Starting with `r15`:**

- In this task, I wrote code that used the regular expression `r"r15\w+"` to extract device IDs starting with `r15`. This pattern matched all device IDs that began with `r15` and included any subsequent alphanumeric characters. The output was a list of device IDs starting with `r15`, such as `['r15u9q5', 'r151dm4', 'r15xk9h', 'r159r1u']`, which correctly captured the relevant device IDs.

3. **Find and Analyze IP Addresses:**

In this task, I wrote code that correctly identified IP addresses in the log_file using the regular expression pattern `r"\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}"`. This pattern matched any potential IP address, although it could also include invalid IPs due to its lenient nature, as it does not strictly limit octets to values between `0-255`. The code extracted all IP-like substrings, both valid and invalid, and the output was a list of all extracted IP addresses from the log.

4. **Flagging and Analyzing IP Addresses for Further Investigation:**

In this task, I wrote code that flagged specific IP addresses for further analysis, such as addresses in the `flagged_addresses` list. The code then printed messages indicating whether each IP address required further analysis, depending on whether it was flagged. This helped in easily identifying IPs that needed additional scrutiny. The output consisted of messages showing which IP addresses were flagged and which did not require further action.
