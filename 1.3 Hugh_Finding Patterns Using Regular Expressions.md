# Finding Patterns Using Regular Expressions

## Proposed Resolution

**Activity Overview**

I focused on identifying patterns in data related to system logs and device activities. The first task was to find the malware signature 0x9ACDAB. I extracted and analyzed this signature from the provided data to detect any potential threats.

Next, I worked on identifying device IDs starting with r15. Using regular expressions, I extracted and displayed the device IDs that matched this pattern, helping automate the process of monitoring devices.

Additionally, I analyzed IP addresses within the logs. Specifically, I identified valid IP addresses in the format 192.xxx.xxx. This step allowed for efficient identification of network-related activities and helped automate the analysis of system logs for security monitoring.
