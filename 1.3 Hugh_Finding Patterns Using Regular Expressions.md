# Finding Patterns Using Regular Expressions

## Proposed Resolution

### Activity Overview

I focused on identifying patterns in data related to system logs and device activities. The first task was to find the malware signature 0x9ACDAB. I extracted and analyzed this signature from the provided data to detect any potential threats.

Next, I worked on identifying device IDs starting with r15. Using regular expressions, I extracted and displayed the device IDs that matched this pattern, helping automate the process of monitoring devices.

Additionally, I analyzed IP addresses within the logs. Specifically, I identified valid IP addresses in the format 192.xxx.xxx. This step allowed for efficient identification of network-related activities and helped automate the analysis of system logs for security monitoring.

1. **Find the Hex Signature:**

The code correctly extracts the malware signature `0x9ACDAB` from the given string using a regular expression. The pattern `r"\b0x[a-fA-F0-9]+\b"` matches any hexadecimal number starting with 0x, which is exactly what the task requires.
Output: `['0x9ACDAB']`

2. **Find Device IDs Starting with `r15`:**

The code uses the regular expression `r"r15\w+"` to extract device IDs starting with `r15`. This matches all device IDs that begin with `r15` and includes any subsequent alphanumeric characters.
Output: A list of device IDs that start with `r15` (e.g., `['r15u9q5', 'r151dm4', 'r15xk9h', 'r159r1u']`)

3. **Find and Analyze IP Addresses:**

The code correctly identifies IP addresses in the `log_file` using the pattern `r"\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}"`. This matches any potential IP address, though it may also include invalid IPs due to the lenient nature of the regular expression (it does not strictly limit octets to values between `0-255`).
The code extracts all IP-like substrings, including both valid and invalid ones.
Output: A list of all extracted IP addresses from the log.

4. **Flagging and Analyzing IP Addresses for Further Investigation:**

The code flags specific IP addresses for further analysis (e.g., addresses in the `flagged_addresses` list) and prints a message indicating whether further analysis is required.
Output: Messages indicating whether each IP address requires further analysis, depending on whether it is flagged.
