# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of all projects seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do Not Report Vulnerabilities in Public Issues:** To protect users, avoid reporting security issues in public forums.

2. **Contact Us Directly:** Send a detailed report to [chanetsa.hugh@protonmail.com](chanetsa.hugh@protonmail.com.). Include:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact and severity.
   - Any possible solutions or mitigations.

3. **Acknowledgment:** I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for resolution.

4. **Resolution Process:** Once the vulnerability is confirmed, I will work to mitigate the issue and release a fix promptly. I may request additional information or assistance during this process.

5. **Responsible Disclosure:** To protect users, I ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until I have addressed it and informed users accordingly.

I appreciate your efforts in helping me maintain the security and integrity of projects.
